    <ul>
      <li><b>Detection:</b> Pick a specific type of creature, such as "goblins" or "humans" or an object, such as "magic swords" or "potions." Your rune glows softly when you are within 20 squares of a chosen creature or object, regardless of line of effect. You can change the type of creature as a maneuver.</li>
      <li><b>Light:</b> Your skin sheds light for 10 squares. You can turn this on and off as a maneuver.</li>
      <li><b>Voice:</b> As a maneuver, you can communicate telepathically with another willing creature you have met before whose name you name, who can speak and understand a language you know, and is within 1 mile of you. You and the creature can respond to one another as if having a normal conversation. You can change the person you communicate with by changing the rune.</li>
