Whenever you judge a creature you can spend 1 wrath to channel your divine power to make them afraid. If the target has P < average, they are frightened of you (save ends). Whenever a creature judged by you to is reduced to 0 Stamina and you judge a new target as a free triggered action, if that new target has P < strong, they are frightened of you (save ends). If the target is already frightened of you, they take damage equal to twice your Presence score instead.",
